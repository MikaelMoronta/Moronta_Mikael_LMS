Your LMS will be a console-based application for managing a library's collection of books. The features you need to implement are: 

Add new books to the collection from a text file supplied by the user (each book has a unique ID number, title, and author)
Remove a book from the collection using its ID number and title
Check out a book by using its title 
Check in a book by using its title
List all books currently in the collection
Your text file should be formatted as follows: each line represents a book, and the id, title, and author are separated by a comma. For instance:

1,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee
2,1984,George Orwell
3,The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald
